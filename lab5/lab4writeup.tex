%Writeup for ENGR202 Lab {INSERT LAB #}
%If editing in vim/vi please insert your own line breaks! This will help keep the file cleaner and easier to edit.

%::Collaboration etiquette::
%In order to better identify changes
%please surround all edits with your
%name as follows:

%BEGIN Zach
%END Zach

%LaTeX will ignore line breaks so to denote
%changes in the middle of a line begin the
%edits on a new line after your name tag
%and then continue with the original on
%the next line following your ending name
%tag.
